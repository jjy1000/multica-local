"""PYTHIA MCP server — give any agent eyes on the planet.

Exposes the local engine API as MCP tools over stdio, so Claude Code, Claude
Desktop, or any MCP client can read the live world, pull forecasts, ask the
oracle questions, and check its track record. The engine must be running
(./run-all.sh); this server is just a thin bridge to http://localhost:8088.

Register it (Claude Code):
    claude mcp add pythia -- uv --directory /path/to/pythia run python -m engine.mcp

Or in any MCP client config:
    { "command": "uv", "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/pythia", "run", "python", "-m", "engine.mcp"] }
